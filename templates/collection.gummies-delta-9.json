The onset of effects normally occurs between 30 minutes and 2 hours after consumption; the effects are at their highest between 2 and 3 hours in. As for the edibles such as gummies, they go through the digestive system and thus take longer to show their effects than when used through inhalation. When using Delta 9 or if one is a beginner or trying out a new dose they should take a small quantity and wait for the effects to kick in before taking more. </p>"

            "answer": "<p>The potency of a Delta 9 gummy will depend on the THC concentration in every serving. The potency of the dose will nearly always be shown in milligrams (mg). There are some gummies that contain a higher level of Delta 9 THC hence are more potent than other gummies. This is relative to the quantity of THC contained in the gummy and this can be found on the label of the product in milligrams per gummy. If you are a beginner to Delta 9, always begin with a low dose to determine how your body will react.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Delta-9 THC derived from cannabis is not legal in all 50 states, as its legality varies based on state regulations. However, under the 2018 Farm Bill, Delta-9 THC derived from hemp is federally legal, provided the product contains no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. Despite this federal allowance, it’s important to be aware of and follow your state’s specific legal guidelines regarding Delta-9 THC products.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Yes, regular use of Delta-9 THC gummies can lead to tolerance over time, meaning higher doses will be needed to achieve the same effects. It’s advised to take breaks to reset tolerance levels or try a <a href=\"https://kushqueen.shop/products/tolerance-break-gummies\" title=\"https://kushqueen.shop/products/tolerance-break-gummies\">tolerance break product</a>. </p>"

If you’re more experienced or know your tolerance, you might want to take a <strong>full gummy</strong> (10mg). Just give it time to work before thinking about a second dose.

If you’re new to THC, start with a <strong>low dose</strong> to avoid any overwhelming effects.
