The onset of effects normally occurs between 30 minutes and 2 hours after consumption; the effects are at their highest between 2 and 3 hours in. As for the edibles such as gummies, they go through the digestive system and thus take longer to show their effects than when used through inhalation. When using Delta 9 or if one is a beginner or trying out a new dose they should take a small quantity and wait for the effects to kick in before taking more. <\/p>"}},"faq_block_XjgMBN":{"type":"faq_block","settings":{"question":"Is Delta 8 or 9 stronger?","answer":"<p>In nearly all situations, Delta 9 THC is considered more strong or potent than Delta 8 THC. Both are forms of THC, but Delta-9 is more potent and has a stronger psychoactive effect than Delta 8 due to the different molecular structure of the cannabinoid.<\/p>"}},"faq_block_TyzKFg":{"type":"faq_block","settings":{"question":"Which Delta 9 gummy is the strongest?","answer":"<p>The potency of a Delta 9 gummy will depend on the THC concentration in every serving. The potency of the dose will nearly always be shown in milligrams (mg). There are some gummies that contain a higher level of Delta 9 THC hence are more potent than other gummies. This is relative to the quantity of THC contained in the gummy and this can be found on the label of the product in milligrams per gummy. If you are a beginner to Delta 9, always begin with a low dose to determine how your body will react.<\/p>"}},"faq_block_k7XrCF":{"type":"faq_block","settings":{"question":"Is Delta 9 legal in all 50 states?","answer":"<p>Delta-9 THC derived from cannabis is not legal in all 50 states, as its legality varies based on state regulations. However, under the 2018 Farm Bill, Delta-9 THC derived from hemp is federally legal, provided the product contains no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. Despite this federal allowance, it’s important to be aware of and follow your state’s specific legal guidelines regarding Delta-9 THC products.<\/p>"}},"faq_block_WBEiWa":{"type":"faq_block","settings":{"question":"Can you build a tolerance to Delta-9 THC gummies?","answer":"<p>Yes, regular use of Delta-9 THC gummies can lead to tolerance over time, meaning higher doses will be needed to achieve the same effects. It’s advised to take breaks to reset tolerance levels or try a <a href=\"https:\/\/kushqueen.shop\/products\/tolerance-break-gummies\" title=\"https:\/\/kushqueen.shop\/products\/tolerance-break-gummies\">tolerance break product<\/a>. <\/p>"}},"faq_block_4FGX6n":{"type":"faq_block","settings":{"question":"What are the effects of Delta 9 gummies?","answer":"<p>Delta 9 gummies can produce effects such as euphoria, relaxation, altered perception, and increased creativity. At higher doses, the effects can be more intense, leading to significant euphoria, deep relaxation, and possibly induce sleep and hunger.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["faq_block_DPdTLX","faq_block_XjgMBN","faq_block_TyzKFg","faq_block_k7XrCF","faq_block_WBEiWa","faq_block_4FGX6n"],"settings":{"faq_title":"Frequently Asked Questions"}},"rich_text_794GPF":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"full_width":false,"section_title":"Need some guidance?","text":"<p><em>Kush Queen, your trusted wellness partner since 2015, serving over 95,000 customers with 5 star-rated delta 9 thc gummies.
