For instance, if a product has 5mg of THC and 5mg of CBD, then it is a one to one ratio of cannabinoids. This balanced formulation is common for those who wish to benefit from both cannabinoids: when combined, CBD can balance the psychotropic impact made by THC, thus making the effect more enjoyable. In addition, 1:1 ratio also delivers more of the entourage effect which is the hypothesis that when cannabinoids are used together they act synergistically to modulate the overall psychoactive effects of the plant. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["faq_block_8hipQj","faq_block_mbbcCU","faq_block_3ywhA6","faq_block_yf7GaP","faq_block_zzBthc","faq_block_4E83pY"],"settings":{"faq_title":"Frequently Asked Questions"}},"rich_text_Kyrk4Y":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"full_width":false,"section_title":"Need some guidance?","text":"<p><em>Kush Queen, your trusted wellness partner since 2015, serving over 95,000 customers with 5 star-rated weed gummies.
