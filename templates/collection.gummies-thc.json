            "question": "What’s the difference between a CBD and a THC gummy?",
            "answer": "<p>THC gummies are psychoactive, which means they can produce a mild to moderate high. In contrast, CBD gummies are non-psychoactive and focus more on relaxation and overall wellness. THC provides a euphoric or body buzz, while CBD is more about easing tension without altering your mental state. Want the best of both? Our 1:1 ratio gummies balance THC and CBD for a smooth, balanced experience.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>THC gummies typically take between 30-60 minutes to kick in, but the timing can vary based on your metabolism and whether you’ve eaten beforehand. Because they’re edibles, the effects are usually more prolonged, lasting anywhere from 4 to 8 hours.</p>"

Delta-8 THC, on the other hand, offers a milder, smoother experience that’s great for people who want the benefits of THC without an intense high. Think of Delta-9 as the full-blown experience and Delta-8 as the more relaxed, functional version.</p>"
