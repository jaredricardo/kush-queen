Factors like metabolism, body weight, and whether you've recently eaten all play a role in how fast you’ll feel the effects. Unlike smoking or vaping, gummies require a bit of patience, so sit back and enjoy the gradual build.</p>"

If you’re subject to drug testing, consider this carefully, and if needed, explore non-THC options like CBD-only products.</p>"
