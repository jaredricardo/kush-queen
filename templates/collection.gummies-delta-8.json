            "answer": "<p>Delta 8 THC and Delta 9 THC are similar cannabinoids but differ in their effects. Delta 9 THC is the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, known for its strong high. Delta 8 THC, on the other hand, offers a milder experience, with less intensity and psychoactivity. It provides euphoria, relaxation, and stress relief but without the overwhelming effects of Delta 9.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Delta 8 THC gummies generally take about 30 to 60 minutes to take effect, depending on factors like your metabolism, tolerance, and whether you’ve eaten beforehand. Some users report feeling effects within 30 minutes, while others may experience the onset after an hour. For most, you can expect the full effects to be felt within this window.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>The effects of Delta 8 THC gummies typically last between 4 to 6 hours. Many users enjoy a prolonged sense of relaxation and relief throughout this period, with the effects tapering off gradually. For some, depending on their tolerance and body chemistry, effects can last up to 8 hours.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>If you’re new to Delta 8 THC, it’s recommended to start with half a gummy (5mg of CBD + 5mg of Delta 8 THC) to see how your body responds. If you’re experienced or looking for more profound effects, a whole gummy (10mg of CBD + 10mg of Delta 8 THC) should provide a deep sense of calm and relaxation.

However, some states have enacted laws that ban or restrict Delta 8 THC, so it’s important to check your local laws before purchasing. Kush Queen complies with local regulations and will not ship Delta 8 THC products to states where they are restricted or prohibited.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Yes, Delta 8 THC may show up on a drug test. Since most drug tests look for THC metabolites, Delta 8 can cause a positive result for THC, as it is chemically similar to Delta 9 THC. If you are subject to routine drug testing, you should avoid using Delta 8 products to avoid a potential positive result.</p>"
